+ Basic programming skills in Python
+ Basic understanding of data structures and algorithms
+ Basic skills for working with data files (i/o operations on csv and tsv files, etc.)

### Getting started

#### Introductional Material

To get started here are some online resources for programming skills in Python and for setting up the required Python development environment.

+ [Jupyter notebook quickstart](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html) A guide on running Jupyter notebooks
+ [Jupyter with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html) Working with Python kernels in Jupyter.
+ [Python Data Science handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) A free book in the form of Jupyter notebooks that introduced the core Python data science libraries ([launch interactive session](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/master?filepath=notebooks%2FIndex.ipynb))
+ [A whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) A free book introducing basic Python programming concepts


#### Installation Instructions
+ We’ll be using the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/?lang=en-us#linuxQ)
+ Download and install the distribution from the link above
+ Start the Jupyter Notebook and open the [Check Environment IPython Notebook](./notebooks/Pre-assignment/check_env.ipynb). (see [Jupyter notebook quickstart](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content-quickstart.html))
+ Run the file and make sure no errors are raised.
