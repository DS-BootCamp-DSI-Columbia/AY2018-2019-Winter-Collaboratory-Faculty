* 22 - constant treatment effect, good overlap
* 8 - constant treatment effect, bad overlap; would have to assume constant effects to estimate for everyone
* 10 - non constant but good overlap; should be possible to estimate correctly
* 19 - non constant, good overlap, not ignorable; we aren't able to estimate from the data that the outlying treated observations are unique, so either there is an unobserved confounder or our estimate of the probability of being treated is inaccurate
* 4 - non constant, no overlap, not ignorable; the same as 19 but even more so
