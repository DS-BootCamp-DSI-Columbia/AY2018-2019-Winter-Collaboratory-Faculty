Data: `MplsDemo` in **carData** package

### 1. Single dot plot

Create a Cleveland dot plot showing estimated median household income by neighborhood.

Use a Cleveland dot plot with multiple dots per row to show percentage of foreign born, earning less than twice the poverty level, and with a college degree in different colors.  Data should be sorted by college degree.

### 3. Interpretation

What patterns do you observe? What neighborhoods do not appear to follow these patterns?
