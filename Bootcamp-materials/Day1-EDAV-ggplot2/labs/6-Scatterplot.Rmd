### Taxis

Data: NYC yellow cab rides in June 2018, available here: http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml

It's a large file so work with a random subset of the data.  

Draw four scatterplots of `tip_amount` vs. `far_amount` with the following variations. For all, adjust parameters to the levels that provide the best views of the data.

### 1. Points with alpha blending


### 2. Points with alpha blending + density estimate contour lines


### 3. Hexagonal heatmap of bin counts


### 4. Square heatmap of bin counts 


### 5. Describe noteworthy features of the data.
