### Day 1 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization with ggplot2

- When: Wednesday, January 9th, 2019
- Where: Room 425, [Riverside Church](../../Misc-files/directions.pdf)

- **Topics**:
- **Mandatory pre-assignment**:

1. Download R from https://cran.r-project.org/

2. Download RStudio Desktop (open source / free version) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

3. Install tidyverse packages with:

 `> install.packages("tidyverse")`
 
If you haven't used R at all previously, I recommend [DataCamp's free Introduction to R course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r). For our purposes, you can skip the matrices and lists chapters, and the ordered factors section of the factors chapter. 

If you're new to ggplot2, please read ["Data Visualization"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) in *R for Data Science* by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham to gain a general familiarity with ggplot2 functions.
