### dplyr

This tidyverse package is very helpful for data transformation.  I recommend becoming familiar with the main "verbs":

`filter`, `select`, `arrange`, `mutate`, and `group_by` / `summarize`

### tidyr

Another tidyverse package, useful for getting data in the right form for graphing.  The main verbs are `gather` and `spread`.

Useful resource: "tidyr::gather() tutorial"

### rmarkdown

* Create a new .Rmd file in RStudio with File, New File, R Markdown...  and choose html.  (To knit to Word or pdf, additional software needs to be installed.)

* Click "Insert" then R to insert a code chunk.

* common uses of chunk options:

`fig.height = `, `fig.width = ` control figure sizes

`eval = FALSE` do not evaluate code

`echo = FALSE` do not show code
